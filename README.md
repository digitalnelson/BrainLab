### BrainLab 
- Making graph analysis of the brain simple and fast

Multimodal analysis of the brain is complex and processor intensive.  Many existing tools require speciality knowledge of programming or at least scripting.  Learning these technologies takes time away from actually analyzing the brain.  BrainLab is designed to be an easy to use windows application capable of using very high performance computing techniques (async programming, GPGPU processing, etc) on inexpensive hardware.  It uses Monte Carlo simulation techniques to evaluate brain data to produce a graph of differences thought to be fundamental to the disease being studied.
